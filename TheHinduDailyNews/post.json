Source unknown Expressing sadness over the death, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said it was a matter of concern that the source of the infant\u2019s infection remained unknown. Efforts were on to trace the epidemiological links and to do COVID-19 testing on a large scale. On Friday, three persons tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the State, while 15 were declared free of the disease, including a 62-year-old in Pathanamthitta who had one of the longest hospital stay of 47 days after she tested positive for the virus.

But our problems are far from over and the threat of the third stage of disease transmission, when there would be massive community spread of the infection, is very real. We are looking at disease transmission projections which say that we will have to arrange treatment facilities for several lakhs,\u201d he said. Nothing is over yet as far as COVID-19 outbreak is concerned and the worst is yet to come.
